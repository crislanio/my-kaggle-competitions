## Introduction
This repository contains my own solutions for [Kaggle Competitions](http://www.kaggle.com). The objective is to share with others my incursions to this addictive competition. You will can see solutions mostly in [Julia](http://julialang.org), [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/). Also solutions in [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/) can appears here if I need more computer power or use an specific library to solve the problem. The problems are all about Machine Learning and Data Science. I put a gitter to facilitate the communication between contributors that want to participate on the competitions. Feel free to discuss any subject related with the competitions.
